# Apple A/UX 0.7 kernel Source

Taken from the infamous [aux07bin.tgz] file, it turns out that there was a nearly complete kernel source tree in there.  Only a few minor changes needed and it can be built using later versions of A/UX.  Suitable for testing on Shoebill.

Source code is originally from UniPlus version 2.1.2
